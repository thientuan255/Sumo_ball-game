Enemies will move toward the player, push them off the base to gain score.
Moiving the ball with vertical input, rotate the camera with horizontal input, 
the ball will rotate with the camera. When pick up"Star" power, 
player can push only white enemies far away, 
pick up "lighting" power allow player use "F" key to fire bullet that can push all enemies. 
The game end when player fall of the base.

Using asset from unity course. 
Ps: Has trouble with adding rolling sound when player move.
